Here is why.</p>\n<p>Many XBRL services providers store XBRL data in a relational database. However, very soon, the limits of homogeneous, flat tables are reached and slow down requests. Other services leverage the fact that the XBRL syntax is based on XML and store it, as is, in an XML database. Yet, the raw XBRL format is not suitable for querying, or at least, for querying with reasonable performance: while XBRL uses the XML syntax, its data model is significantly different from that of XML, in at least the two following ways. If you leave tuples aside, there is nothing flatter than a physical fact. Networks that have no directed cycles (i.e., directed acyclic graphs, often even trees) can be stored in more optimal ways than raw XLink.</p>\n<p>With NoSQL technologies, XBRL can be stored in an way that is optimized for hypercube querying (we called this <em>NoLAP</em>). NoLAP extends the OLAP paradigm by removing hypercube rigidity and letting users generate their own hypercubes on the fly on the same pool of (fact) values. Very much like NoSQL technologies extend the SQL paradigm by replacing flat, homogeneous tables with heterogeneous, arborescent data.</p>\n<p>You can find out all the exciting details and advantages of NoLAP at <a href=\"http://28.io/nolap\" title=\"NoLAP\" target=\"_blank\">http://28.io/nolap</a>.</p>", "tags" : [ "secxbrl" ] }, { "title" : "Measuring Quality by Verifying Fundamental Accounting Concepts and Relations Between Concepts Using Custom Reports", "guid" : "85127528110", "id" : "/85127528110/measuring-quality-by-verifying-fundamental-accounting-concepts-and-relations-between-concepts-using-custom-reports", "updated" : "Thu, 08 May 2014 11:53:00 -0400", "summary" : "In this blog entry, we are addressing the following characteristics: Consistency, accuracy, and comparability.

There are many more such undisputed relations (e.g. &#8220;<a href=\"http://fundamentalaccountingconcepts.wikispaces.com/\" title=\"Fundamental Accounting Concepts\">Fundamental Accounting Concepts</a>&#8221;</span><span>).

For example, assets might not have been reported by a filer, but current assets has been instead. In case noncurrent assets doesn&#8217;t exist, we can impute assets from current assets. Correspondingly, we needed to add a set of business rules (including pre-conditions) to accommodate for such situations.</span></p>\n<p><span>Also, filers could have used different concepts to report the same information. For example, liabilities and equity might have been reported using </span><span>us-gaap:LiabilitiesAndStockholdersEquity</span><span> or </span><span>us-gaap:LiabilitiesAndPartnersCapital</span><span>. To overcome this, this we added a set of <a href=\"https://app.secxbrl.info/concept-map/FundamentalAccountingConcepts\" title=\"Fundamental Accounting Concept Mappings\">concept mappings</a></span><span>(aka aliases or synonyms). This allows us to work with </span><span>fac:LiabilitiesAndEquity</span><span> while the system automatically figures out which of the aliases (</span><span>us-gaap:LiabilitiesAndStockholdersEquity</span><span> or </span><span>us-gaap:LiabilitiesAndPartnersCapital</span><span>) has effectively been reported.</span></p>\n<p><span><br/><span>In the following, we illustrate all the rules of the balance sheet:</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://31.media.tumblr.com/190c742a7e5a621ca2f5ce7f61da9559/tumblr_inline_n5949wHWmo1sfxrpi.png\"/></span></span></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><strong><span>Custom Reports is a General Tool</span></strong></h2>\n\n<p><span>The way information is reported in SEC filings varies significantly.

Yet, even four years later, in December 2012, Suzanne Morsfield and Trevor Harris had to state in a widely-read report that &#8220;without a serious reconsideration of the technology, coupled with a focus on facile usability of the data, and value-add consumption tools, it will at best remain of marginal benefit to the target audience of both its early proponents and the SEC&#8217;s mandate - investors and analysts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In March 2014, <a href=\"http://28msec.com\" target=\"_blank\">28msec</a> launched <a href=\"http://secxbrl.info\" title=\"US Public Company Financial Information Repository\" target=\"_blank\">secxbrl.info</a>, a technological breakthrough that is delivering XBRL&#8217;s promise.
